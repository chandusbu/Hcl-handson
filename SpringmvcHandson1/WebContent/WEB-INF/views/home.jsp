Online social entertainment blends entertaining interactive functionality and content including live video streaming, video chat communications, 
multi-player gaming, music and videos streaming, with social networking service such as social graph management,
forums, reviews, ratings, and geo-location options. It is the foundation for a more immersive, interactive, enriching and engaging content consumption experience through social channels. 
Social entertainment is distinct from social networking websites in that the former is based fundamentally on immersive engaging experiences with functionality, content and people,
 while the latter is based primarily on building and maintaining relationships with other users. Typically, social entertainment is defined by the individual sites dedicated to a particular type of entertainment experience incorporating basic social networking services.
