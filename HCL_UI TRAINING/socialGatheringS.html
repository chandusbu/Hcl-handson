        Social gathering is defined as interactions among a diversity of individuals of all abilities in small,
        medium and large groups for social and community purposes. Street life used to be an integral part of 
        the social life of people. Friends met and hung out on the street, children played there, neighbors 
        caught up with each other, and people watched people. This kind of vibrant street life has been greatly
        reduced over the years primarily due to the increase in vehicular traffic on the street.
        Donald Appleyardâ€™s seminal study "Liveable Streets" (1982) showed that social connections between 
        people on a street were inversely proportionate to the amount of traffic.
