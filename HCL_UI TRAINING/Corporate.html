        This is often the event type most associated with the term "corporate event" by the general public.
        Hospitality is usually used for rewarding, incentivising and building relationships both internally 
        with employees and externally with customers and suppliers. It ranges from a simple dinner to VIP 
        experiences at sporting events and music concerts. Often businesses will sponsor an event receiving 
        hospitality packages and brand visibility across the event, this can happen on various levels, from 
        the local rugby club or football team right through to O2 sponsoring sporting arenas.
